# Octane5 Technical Screening: UI

This is the technical screening task for front-end, UI-centric roles on the Octane5 Development Team.

## User Story

_As a licensee for a major, world-famous brand that has a library of images for licensees to use, I want an "asset library" page that lets me find images by tag, so I can filter all those images down to just the ones relevant to me and choose the right one to use on the product I will design for this brand._


## The Task

Create a prototype of the interface described in the user story above, suitable for inclusion on [https://www.brandcomply.com](https://www.brandcomply.com), using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery only).

Note that the scope for this story is intentionally broad and somewhat open-ended. You may not have enough time to build the perfect prototype solution to this problem.

Imagine your prototype will be used to demonstrate functionality to the client, and after user acceptance, will be handed directly to senior developers for implementation. **Show us your ability to meet this user's most important needs, with an attractive, functional prototype.**

## Requirements

Your submission must:

1. Be submitted within 72 hours of receiving an invitation.
2. Match the color palette and style of [https://www.brandcomply.com](https://www.brandcomply.com). Imagine your submission will live on that site.
3. Use _only_ HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery or raw JavaScript. No frameworks. Do not use Angular, React, Bootstrap, etc.
4. Function perfectly in the latest build of Google Chrome _without a web server_. We must be able to simply double-click index.html from Finder or Explorer to use your prototype.

## Submission

To submit your work, fork this repository, commit your work to your fork, and create a pull request from your fork into this repository.

Alternatively, you may create a ZIP file containing your submission's files and send that file (or a link to that file) to the person who invited you to take this test.

**Incomplete submissions are better than nothing.**

Do your best, thank you for your interest in Octane5 International, and good luck!
